## 📌 Abstract  
<p align="justify">
Requirements engineering (RE) is a critical pillar in software engineering. In addition to influencing critical processes such as project planning, testing, or product quality, incorrect implementation can lead to the failure of entire projects. 
Nevertheless, it could be a complex and time-consuming process: requirements must be clearly defined not conflict with each other, and be understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. AI-driven solutions can play a crucial role in reducing time, complexity, and human effort in the different RE phases. In this study, we explore the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating RE tasks by integrating LLMs into a standard industry RE workflow.
We compare the output of LLMs with human-written specifications (e.g., user stories), identifying strengths, limitations, and potential gaps.
The LLMs can help to automate and standardize the generation of documentation, reducing the time and manual effort required. However, LLMs are also highly dependent on the quality of the inputs and often require significant human revision.
The findings of this study advocate for a synergistic approach where LLM serves as an effective drafting tool while human analysts provide the critical contextual and technical oversight necessary for high-quality RE documentation.
