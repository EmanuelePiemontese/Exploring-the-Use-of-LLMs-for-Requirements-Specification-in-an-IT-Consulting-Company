This repository provides extended analyses, additional experimental results, and supporting resources that complement our main study.  

## 📌 Abstract  
<p align="justify">
In many industries, the process of requirements specification remains a critical challenge. Organizations often struggle to accurately capture and communicate complex system needs, leading to potential misalignments between stakeholders and increased costs. Requirements are typically specified using a Functional Design Specification (FDS), a document that outlines the functional requirements and features of a system, application, or process.
In practice, the knowledge required to generate a FDS is usually fragmented across diverse documents (e.g., meeting minutes, emails, and high-level product descriptions). This makes the specification of the FDS a cumbersome and time-consuming process. This work investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate FDS generation, aiming to reduce effort while maintaining quality.
In this experience paper, we explore the role of LLMs in automating the generation of the FDS in an IT project, involving the management of digital rights, developed by an IT consulting company.We provide LLMs with summarized requirements elicitation documents and FDS templates, prompting them to generate Epic FDS (including high-level product descriptions) and user stories, subsequently compiled into a complete FDS document.
We compared the correctness and quality of the FDS generated by three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT3-turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-70B)  against those produced by human analysts.
Our results show that LLMs can help automate and standardize the generation of documentation, reducing the time and manual effort required. However, the quality of  LLM-generated FDS highly depends on inputs and often requires human revision.
This study advocates for a synergistic approach where LLM serves as an effective drafting tool while human analysts provide the critical contextual and technical oversight necessary for high-quality RE documentation.
