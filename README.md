# 📄 Appendix: Exploring the Use of LLMs for Requirements Specification in an IT Consulting Company  

Welcome to the supplementary materials accompanying the paper:  
**_"Exploring the Use of LLMs for Requirements Specification in an IT Consulting Company"_**  

This repository provides extended analyses, additional experimental results, and supporting resources that complement our main study.  

## 📌 Abstract  
Requirements Engineering (RE) is a cornerstone of software development. It directly impacts critical aspects such as project planning, testing, and product quality. Poorly defined requirements can lead to project failures, making RE both a complex and time-consuming process. Requirements must be clear, non-contradictory, and comprehensible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.  

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising AI-driven solutions to streamline RE by reducing effort, time, and complexity across its phases. In this study, we examine how LLMs can be integrated into a standard RE workflow within an IT consulting company. We compare LLM-generated requirements (e.g., user stories) with human-written ones, assessing their strengths, limitations, and areas requiring improvement.  

Our findings suggest that LLMs can automate and standardize documentation generation, significantly reducing manual effort. However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on input quality and often necessitates human revision. We advocate for a **synergistic approach** where LLMs serve as efficient drafting tools while human experts provide the contextual and technical oversight essential for high-quality RE documentation.
