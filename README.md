# Appendix: Exploring the Use of LLMs for Requirements Specification in an IT Consulting Company  

This repository provides supplementary materials related to the paper *"Exploring the Use of LLMs for Requirements Specification in an IT Consulting Company"*. The appendix includes extended analyses, additional experimental results, and supporting resources that complement the main study.  

## Overview  
Requirements Engineering (RE) is a fundamental process in software development, ensuring that specifications are clear, consistent, and aligned with stakeholder needs. In our study, we investigate the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into standard industry RE workflows, assessing their ability to automate requirements specification tasks within an IT consulting company.  


This repository provides additional material, including:  
- **Project Workflow Diagram**: A graphical representation of the RE workflow, showcasing the various phases of the project and how LLMs can be integrated.
- **Project Phase Tables**: Images outlining the different stages of the project, providing detailed information on the tasks and processes in each phase.
- **Epic FDS Template**: A PDF template for creating Epic Functional Design Specifications (FDS), which is used in the project to define high-level requirements.

## Repository Structure  
- `workflow/` â€“ PDF file containing the workflow diagram of the project, illustrating how LLMs fit into each phase of the RE process.  
- `phases/` â€“ Images detailing tables that describe the different stages of the project and their associated tasks.  
- `templates/` â€“ PDF file of the Epic FDS template, used for structuring high-level functional design specifications.  

These materials are intended to provide further context and practical resources for researchers and practitioners working with AI-driven RE automation. Should you have any questions or wish to collaborate, please feel free to contact us.
