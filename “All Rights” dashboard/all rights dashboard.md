# AllRights
<p style="text-align: justify;">**AllRights** is a platform developed by **Fincons Group** for managing digital rights, designed to enhance the efficiency and monetization of multimedia content. It is a centralized and flexible solution that supports various types of media and languages, allowing easy integration with other systems. AllRights offers advanced tools for managing contracts, copyrights, workflows, and metadata, reducing manual work and optimizing business processes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One of its key features is **"Availability"**, which allows for managing the availability of digital content across different platforms and territories, providing real-time monitoring of when and where content can be distributed or broadcasted, in accordance with licensing agreements. Additionally, **Availability** integrates alerts for the expiration of distribution windows and connects with other modules such as contract management and reporting.</p>


## AllRights Dashboard

### 1. **Rights In Contract List**
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this section, a contract is created by defining the right being acquired and registered within the system. A **"rights in"** contract can cover various types of content, such as episodes of a series or films.</p>

### 2. **Create Item - Content Type**
<p style="text-align: justify;">To create a new catalog item, the process begins in the **"item"** section of the platform. Among the settings displayed in this section, there is a field called **"content type"** that allows specifying the type of content being managed (for example, series, season, film, format). This selection defines the nature of the catalog item for which the rights are being contracted.</p>

### 3. **License Type**
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the platform, it is possible to select various types of periods that define the availability of rights. Here is a description:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Exploitation</strong>: the time frame during which rights can be exercised.</li>
  <li><strong>Hiatus</strong>: a temporary suspension of the rights usage due to specific restrictions.</li>
  <li><strong>Holdback</strong>: a period during which certain rights are protected from being sold to third parties.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Block</strong>: a restriction preventing the use of rights for legal reasons.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These different types of periods can be combined, creating a series of complex scenarios and test cases for managing the availability of rights. The **"availability"** search takes these periods into account to show the actual availability of a right at a given moment.</p>
